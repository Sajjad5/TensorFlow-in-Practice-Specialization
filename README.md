#TensorFlow-in-Practice-Specialization

In this specialization, I got a grounding in what I need to get started with TensorFlow:
at the next steps, such as going deeper into understanding Machine Learning 
and the practice of understanding loss functions, optimizers and more, I learned more about neural networks 
and the different types of layers, from convolutions to recurrent or LSTM. 
I used some of them and seen the impact of different layer types in practice.
